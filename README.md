> as simple as a spreadsheet, as powerful as a database

Everyone makes lists all the time for all sorts of things.

Paper lists are quick and easy but can't be searched or sorted; and have you ever wanted to change the layout later on?

Spreadsheets are pretty great for data entry and you can easily add columns and rows, or move stuff about whenever you want; you can even search and sort the data, but it's awkward and you have to rely on bulky software to view or edit them - and a different piece of software if you want it to sync between devices!

Databases give you ultimate control over the data, structure, and searching. You can configure and reconfigure the interface or query output to display your lists however you want. Web-hosted databases also let you view and edit from anywhere. But have you got the time or knowledge to make one?

Enter skrá: the ultimate list manager.
